        Aims and purpose of Three Minute Learning
    </h1>

    </div>
    <h2 class="text-md mt-4 mb-2 text-tml-blue font-bold "> Why we created it?</h2>
    <p>Three Minute Learning is a social enterprise set up to tackle a vital educational issue. One in six people in
        the UK
        are held back by poor literacy skills (National Literacy Trust statistics). This impairs their employability,
        health, confidence and happiness.
    </p>
    <p> The problem starts very early in school, when children struggle, lag behind their peers and develop mental
        barriers
        to reading that grow stronger with the passing years.</p>
    <p>It doesn't have to happen.</p>
    <h2 class="text-md mt-4 mb-2 text-tml-blue font-bold">Active reading</h2>
    <p>Good readers are active readers. They engage with a piece of writing in many ways, often unconsciously. Research
        has
        discovered these methods of engagement and shown that they can be taught and learned. Passive readers can, with
        practice, become active readers.</p>
    <h2 class="text-md mt-4 mb-2 text-tml-blue font-bold">Support for Three Minute Learning</h2>
    <p> We developed 3ml with support and funding from a number of organisations, including Glasgow University, the
        Scottish Government, the UK Space Agency, the Royal Academy of Engineering and the Science and Technologies
        Facilities Council. We are currently supported by the Scottish Schools Education Research Centre to provide 3ml
        to
        all members of SSERC.

    <h2 class="text-md mt-4 mb-2 text-tml-blue font-bold">How it works</h2>
    <p>A <i>teacher account</i> - provided on request - allows access to the entire 3ml library (&gt; 1000 currently,
        with
        new stories being added constantly).
        The account enables you, the teacher, to:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside leading-loose mx-8">
        <li>create any number of pupil accounts;</li>
        <li>collect a group of pupils into a class;</li>
        <li>select stories around a theme and levels chosen by you, and gather them together into groups (anthologies),
            for
            pupils to work through;</li>
        <li>study pupil responses to assess their progress over time;</li>
        <li>delete inappropriate responses;</li>
        <li>see the leaderboard;</li>
        <li>change individual pupil passwords.</li>
        <p></p>
    </ul>

    <p>A <i>pupil account</i> also gives access to the entire library of 3ml stories. The account enables a pupil to:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside leading-loose mx-8">
        <li>assign stories and anthologies to their work queue;</li>
        <li>select a story, either from the work queue or the whole library, as instructed by the teacher;</li>
        <li>read the story and do the activities;</li>
        <li>submit the responses;</li>
        <li>read colleagues' responses to the same story;</li>
        <li>see the leaderboard.</li>
    </ul>
